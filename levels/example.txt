# If you have one that you feel is MANDATORY [that is, if we don't know how to
# parse it, we should fail entirely], then use two bangs, like so:
#  !!doofus : "Allan"

# Now we start making the map.  The legend for square/entity types is:
# tile:
#   0 space
#   1 wall
#   2 target
# agent:
#   0 none
#   1 box
# Each line should be "%d|%d|%s", which is parsed as tile|agent|location

# I'll describe the location scheme better later.

# Note that you can, if you so desire, intermingle the two kinds of lines.  I
